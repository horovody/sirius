The project is just started and is in progress...

Yet another app to memorize foreign language words. 

It uses stack of ASP.NET Core 2.0, .NET Framework 4.7.1, EF Core, PostgreSQL, IdentityServer4, Angular 5, Angular Material, SASS, Automapper, Autofac, Elasticsearch (not yet implemented), and all other weird words :)
